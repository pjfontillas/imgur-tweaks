When browsing through the gallery captions are initially hidden to prevent spoilers or people just being dicks. The fairies appear on a user page, allowing you to upvote or downvote every single comment that user has ever made. Ever. It'll have some other features, things people request, and stuff I make up just to annoy... I mean entertain... you.",
